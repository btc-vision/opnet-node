# OP_NET Upcoming Changes

This repository contains all the proposal regarding OP_NET and it's changelog.

## OP_NET 1.1.0 (pre-alpha) - What's Coming in the next OP_NET Update?

### 1. New RPC Methods [In Progress]

#### Breaking Change: `btc_simulate`

- **Overview:** The `btc_simulate` method has been significantly enhanced to support more complex simulations.
- **New Features:**
    - State overwrites.
    - Contract code insertion or overwriting by address.
    - Multiple transaction simulations in a sequence (e.g., a -> b -> c).
- **Simulation Actions:**
    - Define an optional sender for contracts.
    - Override custom states.
    - Define or overwrite contract code at specific addresses.
    - Simulate multiple transactions in a chain.
- **Simulation Results:**
    1. Affected states for each transaction with their values.
    2. Transaction receipts, including events, reverts, etc.
    3. Gas estimation for each transaction (convertible to sat).

#### New RPC Method: `btc_gas` [✔️ Completed]

- **Purpose:** Provides gas usage data to estimate the fee required for priority transactions.
- **Response:**
    1. **Top:** Average priority fee over the last three blocks.
    2. **Optimal:** Median priority fee for the last block.
    3. **Rate:** Projected future usage.

#### New RPC Method: `btc_chaininfo`

- **Purpose:** Returns detailed information about the current chain and OP_NET status.
- **Response Example:**

			}
		  },
		  "height" : n,                       (numeric) height of the first block which the rules are or will be enforced (only for "buried" type, or "bip9" type with "active" status)

  ```

#### Modification: `btc_getUTXOs` [✔️ Completed]

- **Breaking Change:** The method now takes an object parameter with additional filtering options.
- **New Parameters Example:**
  ```json
	{
		"query": {
			"address": "str", (string) 
			"filterOrdinals": true|false, (boolean) Filter ordinals UTXOs
			"pending": true|false, (boolean) (optional) return only pending UTXOs
		}[],
		"requiredAmount": n, (numeric) (optional) return at least x amount in sat, otherwise, throw.
	}
  ```

#### Modification: `btc_getBalance` [✔️ Completed]

- **New Parameter:** `includePendingBalance` added to the existing address and filterOrdinals parameters.
- **Response:** Remains unchanged.

### 2. Support for WebSockets [In Progress]

- **Overview:** RPC methods can now be called via WebSocket for improved speed.
- **Event Subscriptions:**
    1. On "block"
    2. On "transaction"
    3. On "epoch"
    4. On "nextBestEpoch"

### 3. Contract Updates [✔️ Completed]

#### Runtime Breaking Changes:

- **Renaming:**
    - `callee` is now `origin` (represents who sent the transaction).
    - `caller` is now `sender` (represents the original sender).
- **New Additions:**
    - Solidity-like constructor method (`onInstantiated`).
    - OP_20 uses storage slots for defining constant properties, allowing deployment from a factory contract.
    - New `StoredBoolean` type added.

### 4. Pending UTXO Tracking [✔️ Completed]

- **Feature:** OP_NET now tracks pending UTXOs.
